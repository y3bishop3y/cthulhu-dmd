  "story": "Ariele Venturi took her first trophy in Africa at the age of thirteen. Since then, no game has been too big, no challenge too great. Across the world, and even across the seas, Shes hunted everything from tions, elephants, and tigers to giant squid and sharks. Yet one expedition to the deepst Congo brought her instead contact with the hidden world. Modern wildlife pales in comparis on to.the errors of the Eldritch world and the.thrill of stalking those abominations: which only see mankind as helpless prey.",
