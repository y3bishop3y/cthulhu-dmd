The boy doesn’t speak, small wonder. Being investigators, you can imagine the horrors he’s seen. It’s bad enough for fully grown adults. With such images inflicted on a young mind, it’s a mercy he only has this one impediment. In fact, you’re not even sure if Julien is his name. It was written on the inside of his shirt collar, as parents sometimes do. Though, if he had parents, no one has spoken up. It’s a bit odd to have a child helping out against such dangerous enemies, but just try and stop him.
