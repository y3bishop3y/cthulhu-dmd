  "name": "Mike",
  "story": "Mikhail was a Russian Strongman for a traveling circus. He would bend bars, juggle fifty-pound weights, and wrestle bears into submission… Well, that last one was probably stage magic, but Mike is capable of some truly astonishing feats of raw might, particularly in a fight. And there is plenty of fighting in this line of work. Mike enjoys the challenge of facing these beasts head-on, which means he’s probably a bit crazy. That said, he’s in good company, since only madmen seek out these nameless terrors and battle them head-on",
