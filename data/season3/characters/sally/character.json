  "story": "As one of the only war correspondents in the trenches during the Great War, Sally had the harrowing duty of photographing that brutal conflict up-close. As such, she became well-acquainted with death, to such a degree that it threatened to extinguish her own smile permanently. But that was before she found a new calling. One might think finding a terrifying, horrific world lurking beneath our own would be even more traumatic, but for Sally, it restored her faith in humanity. Turns out we’re not the worst things out there.",
