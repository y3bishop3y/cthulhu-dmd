  "story": "Huikong has traveled far and wide since an early age, seeking out eldritch horrors and the humans that worship them. But his is not a mission of redemption. There is only one way to redeem those lost to the madness. As such, even at his advanced age, Huikong is one of the most lethal investigators a cultist could have the misfortune to cross. He’s a master of martial arts, an artist of death. To investigators, he’s a voice of wisdom in an insane world.",
