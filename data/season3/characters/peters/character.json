  "story": "Peters was a doctor at a mental institution, though not a psychologist. And place that houses wards of the state needs a physician and surgeon on hand. Luckily, Peters does both. But, more and more, the ravings coming out of some patients’ mouths began to make some sense.

He’s sworn an oath to do no harm, but he doesn’t feel that applies to cultists or monsters.",
