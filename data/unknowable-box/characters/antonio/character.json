  "story": "He doesn’t know the how’s or why’s of it, but Antonio can manipulate certain energies to his substantial benefit. Some magicians do this through years of active study and practice, where Antonio merely wills these ‘effects’ to happen. He suspects he may not be completely human, yet he is absolutely on mankind’s side in their struggle against the elder gods. Antonio’s view is that even a doomed civilization is entitled to live its life without being hurried along to that end by long-gone deities and the fools who worship them.",
