  "story": "Agnes has been an investigator for longer than the current generation has been alive. Yet she was a young woman when the paranormal world came to call, taking her young husband from her and putting her in mourning black. She swore she’d never wear another color so long as the cults exist. Since then, she has learned the art of silent death better than even the creatures she stalks. On an investigation, she’s a shadow, moving from place to place until her blade pierces their flesh. She’s a tragic figure, in truth, but her work gives her peace.",
