  "story": "Isadora ranks among the deadliest spies the world has ever known. There are few secrets she cannot find, and fewer people she cannot kill. When one of her missions brought her into contact with a cult mid-ritual, she found a new use for her talents, rather than spying for nations that could meet her price. One by one, the cultists and their creatures began to vanish until the head cultist found himself alone on the dais. He never saw the blow that struck him down.",
