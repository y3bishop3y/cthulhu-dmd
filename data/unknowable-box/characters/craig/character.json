  "story": "While Craig was quite happy as the maître d’ for an upscale New York hotel restaurant, he served with honor and distinction in the trenches of the Great War. It was a terrible time in his life where he learned skills more apt for a mass murderer than a civilized man. And yet, he now finds himself embracing those old talents once more. Craig would rather be back at his restaurant, but his sense of duty towards innocent life is too strong. It seems he may never be free from the horrors of his past.",
