  "story": "Saito was always good with money, and even better with people. He traveled Western lands for much of his youth and discovered a natural talent for business. He was a millionaire by twenty, and his fortunes have only grown since then. He was a natural target for the cults who often seek to indoctrinate wealthy interests to fund their march to oblivion for all mankind. But Saito was no fool and saw the mewling sycophants for what they were. He now uses his money and considerable fighting skill against them",
