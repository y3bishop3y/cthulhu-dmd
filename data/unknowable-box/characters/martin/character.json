  "story": "Martin’s brand of investigative journalism hits hard and takes no prisoners. He’s exposed scandals from Washington D.C. to San Francisco and back again. Those that abuse their power and authority are on notice any time Martin is on the case. He can’t be intimidated, can’t be bought. So, when his latest story brought him face-to-face with an Old One in a Manhattan high rise, he knew he’d found what would become his life’s work. He can’t really write about the hidden world without causing a panic, but he can lend his formidable skills to his feel investigators.",
