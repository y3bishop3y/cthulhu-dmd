Some people are natural conduits for supernatural forces. As such, they’re often sought by cultists and unwittingly forced to use their powers to assist the cults in their efforts to bring back the Old Ones. One such individual is Amelie, who shows an affinity for gateways across time and space. Simply being near one allows her to bend it to her will. This came as quite a surprise to the cult that had kidnapped her from her employers’ mansion as the gate turned mid-ritual to disgorge gibbering fiends against them. Amelie made good her escape in the confusion.
