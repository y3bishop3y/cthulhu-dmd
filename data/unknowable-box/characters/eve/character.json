  "story": "Eve’s doctoral these was on family dynamics, a far cry from the work she finds herself doing now. While she spends most of her time investigating cult activities and helping banish old ones back to where they came from, the trauma of dealing with these creatures cannot be undersold. Simply being proximate to entities so beyond human understanding has a profound negative effect on the human psyche. Eve has found that many techniques in psych therapy are of great use in easing troubled minds, although there is certainly a point of no return.",
