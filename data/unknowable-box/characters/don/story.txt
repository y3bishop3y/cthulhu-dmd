Don is a survivor of the Great War, and the word ‘survivor’ is the term he uses. Trench fighting against German forces was brutal, bloody, and often a complete slaughter for one side or the other. Don was the ‘last man standing’ too many times. And yet, his commanders kept sending him back again and again. As a result, he doesn’t make friends easily, even among fellow investigators whom he’s come to see as a resourceful group needing protecting. It’s good to know that when the going gets tough, Don will always keep going.
