  "story": "James has hunted prey for sport, food, and trophies on every continent, even Antarctica. It was on that Antarctic expedition that he discovered far more than local wildlife to stalk. Antarctica is home to many alien beasts and species in the caverns far beneath the ice, some of whom inhabited Earth long before mankind ever evolved. James has never hunted people, exactly, though he counted his time in the war as a sort of sport with the most dangerous prey. But hunting dumb animals cannot compare to stalking a foe possessed of intelligence equal to his own.",
