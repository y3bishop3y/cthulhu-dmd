  "story": "Jim is getting on in years but spent the majority of his life in the American West as a hunter, prospector, guide, and even a lawman. He thought to move back east and retire, but like so many other investigators, an encounter with the elder gods and their minions was enough to show him that his rifle was put to better use rather than sitting over a fireplace. Jim can stalk and kill just about any creature that walks, slithers, crawls, or whatever else these creatures do. Even the ones on two legs.",
