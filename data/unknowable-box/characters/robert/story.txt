Robert doesn’t discuss his past. At all. Yet, there is blood there. Anyone that looks into his cold, dead eyes can see it. He’s too old to have served on the front lines of the Great War, so speculation on how and where he became so proficient at killing runs rampant. Rover lets them talk and says nothing about it. He investigates the cults, finds out where they are, and kills them. Simple as that. He’s an exterminator of sorts, one with a very particular prey. It’s a good thing he’s on our side.
