  "story": "Buck has known his share of loss, most notably his entire family. What should have been a weekend getaway to a picturesque seaside bed and breakfast turning into a week-long carnival of death as his family reunion saw him the only survivor. They even got the children. Thus, every death Buck can inflict in their name bring him a little fleeting peace. He’s a grim companion, to say the least. Death is a part of battling the cults, but it’s good to know that it walks at Buck’s side and usually marches to his drum.",
