  "story": "To say Ryan is a bit intense is to call the sun ‘a bit bright’. Ryan lives his life with two modes: on and off. When he’s ‘off’, he’s affable, charming, and laid back. When he’s ‘on’, he’s like a hunting hawk, keen to every twitch, missing nothing, and seeing everything. In the field, Ryan is a predator stalking prey. He’s relentless in his tasks whether than be fighting, fleeing, or chasing down the next clue. Woe betides the cultists and creatures that stand between him and his goals.",
