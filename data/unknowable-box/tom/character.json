  "name": "Tom",
  "story": "Tom is an avid student of history, especially military history. He did a stint in the Army during the Great War, during which time he was a logistics clerk, ensuring that materiel reached the front lines in good working order and, most importantly, on time. He’s found that the same rules apply to his work against the cults. There’s no substitute for the right tool at the right time, whether that’s medical supplies, weapons, or even just a good screwdriver. He seems a little obsessed, but investigators have grown to value Tom’s preparedness, and even sometimes learn a thing or two.",
