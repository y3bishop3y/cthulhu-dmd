Incredibly, years later, that same alcohol allows Jack Munoz to keep the alien insect that lurks in his head at bay. In between his day’s work on the decks and occasional collaborations with some bizarre detectives, Jack fights a personal battle as he tries to stop otherworldly monsters exterminating the entire human race",
