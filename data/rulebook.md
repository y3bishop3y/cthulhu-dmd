## Story Board Discovery Cards
*Page 6*

### Progression Token and Story Board
*Page 6*

The Story board, used in every game, is the hub of information. Each episode has 15 Discovery cards. These include Items, Companions,
and Conditions that can help or hinder you. Most Discovery cards can
be claimed by fulfilling the requirements listed on the card’s central
section. Investigators claim either the left or right side of the card,
tucking them under their investigator board on the appropriate side.
Discovery cards are further explained on page 15.

### The Summoning track shows the progression of the Elder One as
*Page 6*

it manifests into our world. The Elder One figure starts on the left
part of the track and progresses to the right. When it enters a red
space, it will be summoned (it will be summoned earlier if the ritual
is disrupted). After the Elder One is summoned to our world, the If it’s not specified when the investigator may use an effect from a

### Move up to 3 spaces. You can only move between spaces if there is a

also pass between 2 spaces that both have a staircase or tunnel token.

### When you leave a space with enemies, ALL enemies in that space follow

you to your new space (even if there were other investigators in your
space). When you leave a space with Fire tokens, place 1 Fire token from
the reserve onto your investigator board for each token on the space,
leaving those tokens untouched (see “Fire!” on page 16).

### You and all investigators in your space may trade any number of Items

some Discovery cards have Items or Companions on both the left and

was originally. You may not trade Conditions.

by the shortest path to that space. Count how many spaces the enemy
would move in all possible paths, and choose the shortest one. In case
of a tie, the active player chooses. The enemy must always be moved as
much as allowed towards its target, but stops when it reaches its target.

## Summon Enemies
*Page 14*

### Finally, the bottom of some cards will indicate a Gate color and
*Page 14*

the specific enemy that must be summoned there. If you have the
corresponding figure available in reserve, place it on the indicated

enemies indicated, perform the summonings in order. Skip any
remaining Gates if you are out of figures.

## 3. Investigate Or Fight!
*Page 15*

### This step varies depending on whether there are enemies in your space
*Page 15*

or not.

### If you are in a Safe space, INVESTIGATE your space:
*Page 15*

### Draw the top card of the Discovery deck and read the text in the center
*Page 15*

box aloud.

### Some cards will have a statement of something you must do if you have
*Page 15*

a Condition or a certain Companion. Most offer choices of what you
want to do. Some cards result in CLAIMING a Companion, Item, or

### Condition. Claiming means to slide the card under your investigator
*Page 15*

board, becoming part of your inventory (or, when it’s a Condition,
changing your mental state).

### When you first draw a Discovery card, read the central text out loud. This card
*Page 15*

has a bit of speech from the Assistant Janitor. It then tells you to take 1 stress
if you have the Guilty Conscience Condition. Then, you have a choice of either
taking 2 stress to Claim the Janitor or 1 stress to Claim the Bleach.
COMPANIONS: Any wounds you take may be applied to Companions
you currently have instead. This still counts as you taking wounds for
card effects. Companions can never be healed. If their wounds equal
the number on their card, the Companion is discarded and any benefit
they give you is immediately lost. Companions may also give you a
level in a skill. If you don’t have that skill, you gain level 1 in that skill
while you have this Companion with you (take the corresponding
token). If you already have the skill, move the skill level marker 1 level
forward. If you lose the Companion, move the marker back 1 level.

### If you are not in a Safe space, the enemies FIGHT you:
*Page 15*

### Do not draw a Discovery card. Instead, each enemy in your space

### Jerome, the Assistant attacks you in the order you choose (they ignore other investigators),
