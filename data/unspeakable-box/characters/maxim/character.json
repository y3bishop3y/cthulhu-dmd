  "story": "Maxim Grey wished for the quiet life of a clockmaker and tinkerer. Puttering about his shop gave him no end of peace until that fateful day when he intervened in a stress fight outside his establishment. Most investigator operate in the shadows, but all too often violence spills inté the public eye, and on this occasion, a gateway was involved. Maxim Grey was one of the few left standing when the red haze lifted from his eyes. He has slept poorly ever since.",
