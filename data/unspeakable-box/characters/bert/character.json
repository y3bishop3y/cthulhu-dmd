  "story": "Albert Einstein is the worlds foremost theoretical physicist, recipient of the Nobel Prize, and father of special relativity, ah entirely new branch of science. But what is less widely known is that his work on relativity related more to puzzling out the substance of the universe, and what he wound there horrified him to his soul. In his study-of the Necronomicori, Einstein discovered that mathematics lay at the core of arcanism and that magic is function of sciénce. Fortunately, most cultists have litile grasp of even basic scientific principles.",
