Shes something of a mystery to investigator, and her knowing gaze and thousand-yard stress speak to a potential age far beyond her diminutive stature. She has no apparent need of guardians or guidance in her one-child campaign against the cults and their otherworldly allies. She shows a special andinity for interdimensional gateways, gaining obvious strength and acumen from the proximity. This could hint at a supernatural origin for The Kid, but her glee in destroying said gates and the beings they summon speaks to no allegiance.",
