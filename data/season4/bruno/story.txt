Bruno was court-martialed in the Great war for ‘excessive brutality’ against the enemy. Given the savage nature of that conflict in the trenches, it’s hard to image the kind of acts he might be responsible for. That said, prison only darkened his reputation, as he was sent to solitary confinement multiple times for a series of ‘accidents’ that maimed or outright killed other prisoners. It was there that he learned of the cults and the horrors they worshipped. And it was ther that other investigators found him, atop a pile of cultist bodies.
