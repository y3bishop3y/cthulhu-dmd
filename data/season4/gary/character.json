  "name": "Gary",
  "story": "Gary was a miner and foreman, digging up cool and other ores in the Appalachian Mountains. One fateful day. His crew dug a little too greedily and too deep, and discovered the ruins of an ancient city far below the Earth. That night, the ghostly resident of that alien place came to the surface to attack the mining camp, killing all but Gary. He collapsed the mine, cutting off whatever was keeping these spirits walking around on the surface. He now works with his fellow investigators to stop these things any way he can.",
