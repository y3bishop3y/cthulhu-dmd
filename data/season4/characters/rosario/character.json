  "story": "Rosario is a straightforward, plain-talking country girl from rural Mexico who knows as much about engines and mechanics as she does firearms. She doesn’t have the kind of fancy education that other investigators do, and she isn’t necessarily the best shot, but what Rosario does she does with her whole heart and with guns blazing. That also means fighting eldritch cults. They’re no good for the world. They don’t belong in it. And when there’s something out on the farm wreaking havoc, well, some things just need a good killing.",
