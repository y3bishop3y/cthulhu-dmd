  "story": "John has spent more time in war than peace. He retired a Brigadier General and thought he would spend his twilight years on his family estate in England. Sadly, he was wrong. A secretive cult set its sights on his family’s land, owing to the river of dark power flowing beneath it. His entire family, from grandchildren up, were killed in the attack, which was thwarted by a team of investigators and his own skill in battle. John now works with investigators, advising on how best to prosecute their secret war.",
