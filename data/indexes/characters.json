What should have been a weekend getaway to a picturesque seaside bed and breakfast turning into a week-long carnival of death as his family reunion saw him the only survivor. They even got the children. Thus, every death Buck can inflict in their name bring him a little fleeting peace. He’s a grim companion, to say the least. Death is a part of battling the cults, but it’s good to know that it walks at Buck’s side and usually marches to his drum.",

It turns out she has a natural magical talent which can make even the most horrific creature into an unwitting ally. Many cults have various eldritch creatures they use as guardians, enforcers, and attack dogs. With Anita around, it’s only a matter of time before the creature turned against its former masters. Or, as she puts it, “You two fight and we’ll deal with whatever’s left.”",

While she spends most of her time investigating cult activities and helping banish old ones back to where they came from, the trauma of dealing with these creatures cannot be undersold. Simply being proximate to entities so beyond human understanding has a profound negative effect on the human psyche. Eve has found that many techniques in psych therapy are of great use in easing troubled minds, although there is certainly a point of no return.",

Craig would rather be back at his restaurant, but his sense of duty towards innocent life is too strong. It seems he may never be free from the horrors of his past.",

A few old boxes, a battered old sofa, a bookcase pulled down into an odd angle… anything works. Of course, the biggest barrier to their passing is Michelle herself. Having played cricket in the professional leagues, she’s not easy to get past, particularly if she’s got any kind of weapon.",
